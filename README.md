# motion-benchmark-ips

Provides iteration per second benchmarking for RubyMotion.
The original is https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-benchmark-ips'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motion-benchmark-ips


## Usage
```
Benchmark.ips do |x|
  # Typical mode, runs the block as many times as it can
  x.report("addition") { 1 + 2 }

  # To reduce overhead, the number of iterations is passed in
  # and the block must run the code the specific number of times.
  # Used for when the workload is very small and any overhead
  # introduces incorrectable errors.
  x.report("addition2") do |times|
    i = 0
    while i < times
      1 + 2
      i += 1
    end
  end
end
```
